# Babies First Python Projects

My Initial Commit was to save the progress I had made on a computer I'm repurposing as a server. They are really beginner follow-alongs, but I did make a few working things. 

My first project was a command line Hangman game with a hint of dark humor. 
After that I worked on really basic automation techniques like parsing a list or pulling out pieces of a word from a list, etc. 

I'll probably continue to add to this, I plan on doing a bootcamp or a full course in the future. Until then it will live here.
